Across the board, nonprofits share two huge common needs:</p><ol><li>Technology infrastructure. By infrastructure we mean all the software that helps the nonprofit meet their own needs on a day-to-day basis. This includes authentication of users, productivity solutions, and more.</li><li>Public communication. Every nonprofit needs a website, fundraising campaigns, events, volunteer management, and more.
